North Korea says it won't restart nuclear talks despite President Trump's birthday message to Kim Jong Un. https://t.co/tCifZ4YUBhDamn it 2020 why do you need to start so fucked up already? 
First: WWIII is announced 
Second: Neil Peart's death
Third: JEFFREE STAR AND NATHAN BREAK UP

Upcoming: Nuclear war between USA and North Korea is announced and we all die idk@thehill @TheHillOpinion And what has North Korea done since Bobo Num Nuts became USA President making nuclear missiles when other President were in office they didn’t fire and missiles over or near Japan and I been living for 73 years@theTmarshall @darejob @tsparks611 @atrupar North Korea we are discussing never had a credible nuclear position till W Bush provoked them. Kim Jong-un isn’t as stupid as Gaddafi in handing over his ace in the pack and ending up in a sewer pipe shot with his own pistol lied too by USA@Partisangirl The United States does not want Iran to have a nuclear weapon to dominate it, but it has Russia, China, North Korea, Pakistan etc. that can erase it from the map to the USA and do not do so because the communists have interests with the USA and with the Illuminati 😡In Vietnam Trump suddenly presented a paper bluntly demanding KJU hand over all of North Korea’s nuclear weapons material prior to any sanctions relief or improved diplomatic ties. The US remains committed to max pressure. Why should NK negotiate for show? https://t.co/ZRANC3eQpKADDRESSES WITH SOME BLIPS OF USA BASED IP ADDRESSES.
B&gt; NORTH KOREA HAS BOTH TACTICAL AS WELL AS STRATEGIC TYPE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE ONLY PART OF THE LONG RANGE ICBM WHICH HAS NOT BEEN ACTUALLY VERIFIED IN FLIGHT TEST IS THE RE ENTRY SHIELD THAT PROTECTS THE WEAPON,@NBCNews North Korea has seen that Trump and the USA are dishonorable and do not abide by nuclear agreements. 

Kimmy Boy's not stupid.@ericbolling @realDonaldTrump Within one year North Korea will have a ICBM that is within range of West coast of USA that is also capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. Are you not a little more concerned that your dictator Trump is kissing Kim’s ass and allowing selfies on the most volatile border on earth?And this error happened with Iran not having nuclear weapons.
When Iran get nuclear weapon, they may just be targeting USA and mistakenly hit North korea.
🤣🤣
I will just park my load and go to Jupiter. That North korea boy no dey hear sorry.Why the USA treats Iran differently..North Korea also has got it's own Nuclear program actively running!Nuclear power Country :

A Nobel Peace prize is all he cares about.UN Charter court and F Affairs USA informed North Korean IBM'S Continental Nuclear Missile's Attack Range NY,UN.ORGANIZATION, USA,North Korea Destroyed IBM's Missile's Immediately.

https://t.co/oPHswtml9oIndia needs to start working on arming Vietnam with nuclear weapons to counter China. 

This plan was dropped by Vajpayee and UPA but we must go ahead with it now. China supplied nukes to Pakistan &amp; North Korea to counter USA &amp; India. We need to act like a superpower to be one.@natethefurry &gt;all nuclear on our planet are enough to destroy us 7 times. Nuclear weapon is the restraining factor. 
Don't worry about this, anyway we don't know when it happens. Danger zones are Russia(and some countries surround us), USA and North Korea, as I think, they are the biggest&gt;@NarangVipin North Korea has nuclear weapons. Consequently, they're scared to death of a US bloody nose strike. How have nuclear weapons made North Korea's government safer? 

North Korea tied their own hands with nukes that can hit the USA.@WhiteHouse Just like North Korea will never have ICBM’s that could carry nuclear war heads to the continental USA, &amp; just like you said you have no idea where Michael Cohen got the money to pay off Stormy Daniels.@Red17Penguin @StratSentinel I'm surprised you're still wandering around in Iran.
With all this heightened tension in &amp; around Iran, the country doesn't need any more traitors.
USA doesn't attack North Korea because it has nuclear weapons, enough to make USA think twice in what it does.
Iran should have them@ChrisAuckland @jimjammin4 @OwenJones84 @labourlewis We are safe because we and our allies have nuclear weapons. If you don’t have nuclear weapons you are not safe. It’s almost as simple as that. Look at Iran and compare their position to North Korea’s. You don’t see the USA blowing up number 2 in Pyongyang (Kim does that himself).USA should focus more on North Korea than Iran. There is a mad man in Asia with a Nuclear button in his hand.

#IranWarNorth Korea doesn’t have a right to ever end its nuclear program when the second Holocaust is still occurring by United States Federal government law enforcement management officers that which began under the POTUS Obama administration &amp; has not stopped yet &amp; I like Donald Trump https://t.co/m8QDcTADSohttps://t.co/vNDBx7OSLe

#Politics #Article #NewEra@davidangelina11 If we are to have a world war it’s the end of it , because deadly weapon of mass destruction will be used . The USA 🇺🇸 has them and North Korea 🇰🇵, China 🇨🇳, and deadly Russia 🇷🇺 and all these countries are enemies with USA 🇺🇸. So they would use nuclear weapons if there is a war@ianbremmer Trump wins in a short term. But in a long term, he loses terribly. IMO, unstable region &amp; nuclear weapons are two big threats. That would give the USA new headaches b/c Iran would have nuclear weapons so the USA might not attack. Same with North Korea. Poor future Presidents.@biannagolodryga @maggieNYT @SangerNYT Same with North Korean nuclear scientists. Trump’s spectacular foreign policy failures have actually accelerated the time tables for Iran and North Korea becoming nuclear powers!@Scavino45 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS In fact Iran is intensifying their nuclear programm as you screwed up the USA &amp; Iran Treaty. Bullying and threatening words don't work....just look at what you did to North Korea. You are just a bad President with little leadership skills!!@WhiteHouse The USA, Israel, Russia, Pakistan, India and North Korea have nuclear weapons. Why not Iran? Why is this discrimination?

The USA has been soft as shite with many of these countries - Biden "China's no threat"

FFS

Then we discover he's taking zillions to look the other way, same in Ukraine

On and on it goes@_SJPeace_ Bullshit.
Usa government wanna be isolated. They don’t wanna give a shit about world anymore. Just they wanna remove the threat of china-iran-north korea connection. They are related with nuclear bomb and terrorism.
It’s not imperialism. Stop lying. Don’t act like innocent.and made Iran renew its threats that culminated to the attach of the Iranian General Qesam.
In fact he has caused USA and UN retrogression on the gains made to tame Iran.
Also, Iran will regret of not going ahead with its nuclear programme.
After all, North Korea is pariah state@reaccionapr @WhiteHouse North Korea hasn’t discontinued their nuclear ICBM program. To the contrary. Trump has pulled out so many international agreements that our own foreign allies don’t trust the USA. Trump is the laughing stock of the United Nations and the G7!!!@SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr @TimesofIsrael "The United States has accepted North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.’ This is the headline, the nuclear expert David Santoro noted in reference to the image of Trump and Kim standing beside each other at the inter-Korean border...".

1.Expecting delivery of a minimum of three nuclear warheads, covertly from Pakistan and/or cooperatively from North Korea.
2.Iran will demo detonate one warhead as a warning to USA, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. ......@HaleelKing @HassanRouhani It's not funny. Russia, North Korea and China are looking for the chance to attack USA. In conclusion India will also attack on Pakistan. And remember every country I mentioned are Nuclear power. It will be the end of the world 🗺@sybilsdad I agree the US can not prevent any nation from securing nuclear weapons nor nuclear programs.

USA loves conflict too@mira_quiambao Whilst North Korea continues to improve and test its long range missiles &amp; nuclear capabilities. Within a year it will have a missile capable of reaching west coast USA. The most important thing on Trumps agenda is re-election &amp; distraction from impeachment! Are people blind??!!Just like the earthquake that struck North Korea nuclear plants,USA has just taken out Iran's nuclear capabilities.USA military has highly sophisticated equipment.

Yes the USA has nuclear weapons. Iran on the other hand does not the capability to launch a nuclear attack. If anything North Korea have more of a successful nuclear weapons program and that says it all...There was no nuclear military agreement with North Korea : Trump tried to get one with his « friend » Kim Jong-un. 

There was an international nuclear deal (co-signed by USA under Obama) with #Iran and backed by UN : Trump decided to leave it. 

Why?

#IranvsUSA or #USAvsIran@IntezAli @BLabe33 @davidrake101 @MargieKoenig1 @MarkBrining @lukas_poseida @AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump I might suggest, that China's limited nuclear inventory, may not measure up to the same capabilities that the USA has.

US military professionals should KNOW thisUSA knows not to pull some shit like that with North Korea we’d catch that nuclear static real quick@MbuyiseniNdlozi @numbaONEhustla Will the #USA ever have the courage to attack one of the countries that have nuclear weapons?

Trump diplomacy:

- North Korea has now nuclear weapons
- Iran again developing nuclear weapons
- Iran/USA at the brink of war
- IS on the rise again
- Strategic positions in that region lost to Russia
- Kurds, the best opposition against IS, betrayed

You still #MAGA ?@zmooc @nytimes I don’t trust Iran or North Korea right now. And I am against either of them having nuclear weapons.

What is it with Usa and foreign policy, it stinks shit everywhere you have been.@realDonaldTrump That's what do you thinking about north Korea You don't any idea of Iran and I don't any idea of Iran have a nuclear weapons or not but Iranis Is Unity With you And Openly challenge war to USA .Russian aggression and American stupidity in the face of it has destroyed nuclear non-proliferation.

Ukraine gave up nukes for security assurances. #RussiaInvadedUkraine but the USA did nothing.

Putin puppet Trump bungled North Korea, then attacked Iran.
