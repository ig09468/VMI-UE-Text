To the leaders of Iran - DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS. Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!John Kerry got caught essentially admitting that funds given ridiculously to Iran were used to fund attacks on the USA. Only a complete fool would have given that 150 Billion Dollars Plus to Iran. They then went on a Middle East Rampage! @foxandfriends @PeteHegsethPresident @realDonaldTrump should tweet in Farsi regularly. It destroys the narrative the crazy clerics in Tehran have created and maintained about him and America. The President of the USA speaking directly to Iranians in Iran is a nightmare for the Ayatollahs. Keep it up.@PolitiBunny Protesters in Iran &amp; China risking their lives to gain a fraction of the freedoms we have in the USA - freedoms ignored &amp; unappreciated by so many oblivious idiots here. Smdh.

#SundayThoughts  RAPES https://t.co/mn7SHHMJPbMorons blaming Trump/USA for Iran's shootdown of Ukraine airliner:
We didn't strike Iran. We killed an asshole Iranian in IRAQ. We've been bombing people in IRAQ for 30 years without this happening. This is IRAN'S fault alone. Sorry Tulsi, your wrong.In 2050, believe historians will look back on 2020 baffled as to why USA sought conflict with Iran, put up with Saudi &amp; remained in Iraq, when US is a net exporter of oil &amp; the great challenge to America is China.WOW.  The people of Iran and STANDING UP against a dictator.  Why aren't the people of the USA standing up in greater numbers against Trump's movement toward dictatorship?  https://t.co/4ul4boxAzx@LiarMPs @magenta_17 1 USA lead by Trump kills Iranian terrorist in Iraq.

I don't care what the facts are." https://t.co/MIAI1dZnbtI agree, he hasn't changed his views or commitment.  He is in effect saying NO President should drag the USA into foreign wars.
