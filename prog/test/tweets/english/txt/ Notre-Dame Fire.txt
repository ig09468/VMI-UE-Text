When our planet catches fire, there's very little. These fires in Australia has killed HALF A BILLION ANIMALS

More exposure, sympathy &amp; money are needed

https://t.co/dCJpFdDEY4@MikeRJohnson777 This is sick. As an atheist, knowing that the fire that destroyed Notre Dame, was an accident. It does not mean world history isn't important to preserve. Calling their historical landmarks far game in war, is sick. It becomes a bullshit tribal tit for tat contest.A feature from Nature on the unexpected scientific opportunities opened up by the fire at Notre Dame de Paris. https://t.co/ogvIORm09y@tslaqpodcast Diesel car story is not plausible. Especially since the narrative changed over night. They don't want to admit it was a BEV for political reasons. It's similar to last year's fire at Notre Dame de Paris where they didn't want to admit it was arson."Europe ought not to lose that sense of solidarity that has for centuries set it apart, even at the most difficult moments of its history.

"The fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris showed how even what seems so solid can be fragile and easily destroyed"I made a lot of money from the fire in Notre Dame Cathedral.

Fingers crossed for an honest/accurate scientific report.

Remember the fire at Notre Dame?  Same immediate certainty...@1776Stonewall Didn't think it was done by Scottish Presbyterians. Just like Notre Dame fire. Started by Muslims.
