Nah mate. I'm not a fan of gammon or racism so I won't be up for celebrating this cringeworthy disaster.If we stay in the EU, no grand disaster awaits us. Life goes on. None of our other problems are fixed, but they're not caused by our EU membership so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

If we leave, we keep all our existing problems and Brexit dumps a million new ones on us.
